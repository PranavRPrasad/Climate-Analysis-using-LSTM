+ Developed an LSTM-based RNN model for predicting future climate values using the Jena Climate Dataset, featuring attributes like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
+ Achieved a final validation loss of 0.1343 and a testing loss of 0.1135 after 10 epochs of training, demonstrating effective model training on climate prediction.
