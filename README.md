# Gist
+ Built an LSTM-based model with two layers (32 and 16 units) to predict climate patterns using the "Jena Climate 2009â€“2016" dataset.
+ Reduced training loss from 0.3175 to 0.1135 and validation loss from 0.1627 to 0.1343 over 10 epochs.
+ Visualized training and validation performance to evaluate model accuracy and prevent overfitting.
